## Introduction

Welcome to my project! This is a simple README.md file demonstrating how to include mathematical formulas using LaTeX syntax in Markdown.

## Mathematical Formulas

### Example 1: Inline Formulas

You can include mathematical formulas inline by enclosing them in single dollar signs (`$`). For example, the formula \(E = mc^2\) can be written as `$E = mc^2$` in Markdown.

### Example 2: Displayed Formulas

You can include larger mathematical formulas that are displayed on a separate line by enclosing them in double dollar signs (`$$`). For example, the formula for the quadratic equation can be written as:

$$
x = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{{2a}}
$$

### Example 3: Subscripts and Superscripts

You can include subscripts and superscripts using the underscore (`_`) and caret (`^`) symbols, respectively. For example, the formula \(x_1\) can be written as `$x_1$` and the formula \(x^2\) can be written as `$x^2$`.

### Example 4: Fractions and Sums

You can include fractions using the `\frac{}{}` command and sums using the `\sum` command. For example, the formula for the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers can be written as:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{{n(n+1)}}{2}
$$

## Conclusion

That's it for this basic README! Feel free to explore more advanced LaTeX syntax for including mathematical formulas in your Markdown files.
